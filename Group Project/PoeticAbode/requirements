### How to use this `requirements.txt`:

1. Save the above content in a file named `requirements.txt` in the root directory of your project.

2. To install the dependencies, run the following command in your project directory:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Explanation of the dependencies:
- **pygame**: Used to create the interactive interface, display images, and handle sound.
- **numpy**: Often required for numerical operations, especially when working with models or image processing.
- **torch**: PyTorch is a common library for running machine learning models. It's likely needed for your pre-trained model (if you're using PyTorch).
- **transformers**: Hugging Faceâ€™s `transformers` library is a popular choice for text generation models, so it's included in case you're using a language model for generating poetry.
- **Pillow**: A powerful image processing library, which is useful for manipulating and displaying images (like room backgrounds and stickers).
- **requests**: If your app needs to fetch external assets, such as sounds or images, from online sources.
- **python-dotenv**: Allows you to manage environment variables, which could be helpful if you have sensitive configuration or keys stored in a `.env` file.
