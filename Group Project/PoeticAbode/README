# Project Name: Poetic Abode

## Project Overview
**Poetic Abode** is an interactive application that helps users generate healing poetry based on their personalized "Guka Cottage" (咕卡小屋). Users can customize their Guka Cottage, and the application will generate warm, healing poetry tailored to their unique setup. The generated poetry will be displayed on a digital journal page. The app uses a pre-trained model to create personalized content, offering each user a unique and soothing experience.

## Features
1. **Personalized Guka Cottage**  
   Users can customize their own Guka Cottage by selecting various decorations, themes, and elements. These choices will influence the generated poetry, ensuring a personalized healing experience.

2. **Generate Healing Poetry**  
   After customizing the Guka Cottage, users can click a button to generate a piece of healing poetry. The poetry is created using a pre-trained model, influenced by the user's cottage setup, bringing comfort and relaxation.

3. **Digital Journal Display**  
   The generated poetry is displayed on a digital journal page. Users can view, save, and share the poetry, capturing their personal healing moments.

4. **History Log**  
   Every generated poem is saved in the app, allowing users to revisit past poems and relive their healing moments.
